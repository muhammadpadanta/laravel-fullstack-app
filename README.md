## About the App

Our application is built using the Laravel PHP framework, which provides a solid foundation for developing web applications. Laravel offers a wide range of features, including a powerful routing system, database migrations, authentication, and much more, making it an ideal choice for building robust and scalable web applications.
<br><br>
In addition to Laravel, we've utilized TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows us to rapidly build custom designs without the need for writing traditional CSS. TailwindCSS provides a comprehensive set of pre-built components and utilities, enabling us to create beautiful and responsive user interfaces with ease.
<br><br>
To further enhance the design of our application, we've integrated DaisyUI, which extends TailwindCSS with additional components and utilities. DaisyUI offers a variety of ready-made UI components, such as buttons, cards, navigation bars, and more, making it incredibly easy to create stunning and professional-looking interfaces.
